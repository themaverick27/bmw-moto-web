## Key Features & Techniques

The code incorporates several modern web development techniques to achieve its responsive design and interactive elements:

* **Responsive Layout with Flexbox and Grid**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using a combination of [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) and [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for efficient content distribution and alignment.
* **Intersection Observer for Animations**: Elements animate into view as the user scrolls, leveraging the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) for performance-optimized animations.
* **Smooth Scrolling**: Achieves a fluid navigation experience through [CSS `scroll-behavior`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) and JavaScript.
* **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: Utilizes [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for consistent styling and easy theme management, making it simple to update colors and other design elements.
* **Efficient Asset Loading**: Images are optimized for web, ensuring fast load times without compromising visual quality.
